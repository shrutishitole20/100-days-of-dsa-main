**Recursion**

- In recursion, we do not make the input size small but it happens as an effect due to the decision that we make at each step
- our goal in recursion is to make decisions, the input will become smaller automatically.
- Recursive tree help in solving recursion problem, if recursion tree is made then we can assume that the problem is solved.
